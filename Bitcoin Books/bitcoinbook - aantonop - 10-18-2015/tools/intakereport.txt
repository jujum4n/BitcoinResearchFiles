Resources
=========

** Figs: Illustrations is still working on the figs. 
   63 total. (0 are informal; 0 are inline.)

   Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo in Git.

** Intake Report:
   (Git repo) tools/intakereport.txt

** MS Snapshot:
    To view the submitted files, you'll need to checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' 
    by running the following command in your checkout:
    
    $ git checkout manuscript_to_prod
    
    This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag 
    was created. 
    To switch the files back to the current state, run:
    
    $ git checkout master
  
  
Notes from Tools:
=================

** Syntax highlighting: applied to 99 out of 197 code listings.

** I cleanup up a bunch of xref validity issues, but there are still a few remaining (I wasn't sure what the xrefs were suppose to point to). You will need to build with --invalid-ok on the command line until these are cleared up. They are the following:

<<bitcoin-commerce>> in ch01.asciidoc
<<signature>> in ch04.asciidoc
<<public_key>> in ch04.asciidoc
<<appdx_pycoin>> in ch03.asciidoc
<<orphan_transactions>> in ch06.asciidoc

** Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems for which we can help automate a fix.


Notes from Dan:
==================

Ready for intake. Leave this in Atlas 1 (asciidoc).

One of the latex equations in chapter 4 is failing: it's right after Figure 4-2. [FIXED --TOOLS] Regarding the math in this book, please look at each latex passthrough and, wherever 
possible, reset the math using text and inline markup. There isn't a great deal of math in the book, and most if not all could be set using simple text and italics as 
needed.

Some tables includes code that needs to be broken (so the table won't extend off the page).

Prod: there's a lot of code extending into the margin.

Chapters 10-12 are really an Appendixes. Please correct the markup. [DONE --TOOLS]

==================

Please let me know about any other issues.

Thanks,
Chris
